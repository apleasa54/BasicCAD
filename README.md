## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

This is how you will write image code for INTERNALLY STORED images on your repo.   just FYI.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
This is the caster mount, It is a square 120mm by 120mm with four symmetric holes in each of the corners, and a bigger hole in the center, The mount goes on top of the base and is extruded to 8mm.

### Reflection
 This was my second part on onshape, This part was very simple since all it was dimensioning and extruding. I did this part with no follow along and I felt this was a good oppurtunity to get to know onshape since I already new the basic functions required.

## Fork

### Description
This part kind of has a resemblance to an electrical cord. this part has a circle with two symmetrical "prongs" going out of one side that is 75mm long with fillets on every edge. The other face of the extruded circl has a hollow cylinder extruded to 65mm. The two prongs also have a hole in the top of them to accomodate for the axle

### Reflection
This part wasn't too bad, It was kind of confusing at first, or at least it looked a little compplicated and more intimidating the mount but It was still pretty basic once I got the hang of It. I learned a little more about onshape during making this part, and had new tools such as the fillet and chamfer options introduced to me for the first time while making this part.
